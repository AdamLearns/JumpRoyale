## How to play

The only way to play is for Adam to be streaming the game. At that point, you can use the following commands in his [Twitch chat](https://twitch.tv/AdamLearnsLive):

- `join`: joins the game. Available at any time, although you'll only really stand a chance at winning if you join in the first ~45 seconds. üòâ
- `jump [angle=0] [power=100]`: jumps in the given angle with the specified power.
  - `angle` can be from `-90` to `90`.
    - `-90`: ‚Üê
    - `-45`: ‚Üñ
    - `0`: ‚Üë
    - `45`: ‚ÜóÔ∏é
    - `90`: ‚Üí
  - `power` can be from `1` to `100`.

Jumping is so important that there are lots of shortcuts for how to jump!

- `j` and `r` also jump, e.g. `j 45` or `r 45` to jump ‚ÜóÔ∏é.
- `l` jumps to the left, e.g. `l 45` to jump ‚Üñ.
- `u` jumps straight up.

To bypass the same-message limitation on Twitch, add some garbage letters after commands that you want to repeat:

- `u`: jump up
- `u a`: jump up again
- `u bbbb`: jump up again

## Customizing your character

`char <choice>` - change your character graphic. This is only for cosmetics and will be saved between the sessions.

> [!Note]
> Character customization is not saved during the Result Screen

- `choice` is a number from `1` to `18`

- `glow [color]`: change your glow color. This is for subscribers, VIPs, and moderators only.
  - If `color` isn't specified, it'll take the color of your Twitch name.
  - `color` is in the form `RGB` or `RRGGBB`, e.g. `color f00` to set it to red, `color f0f` to set it to pink.

## Extras

- You can **revive** yourself using channel points. This isn't guaranteed to work, nor should you feel good about winning if you use this feature. üòõ

---

## Background

- Designed live (see [the design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YoMtmxC9b5bVoKzm7LxIQ2DxAr3bq84uruarrXFOgQQ/edit))
- Developed hastily in three days (although there'll probably be minor improvements made in the future... üëÄ)

## Building, running, testing

- Prerequisites:
  - Install [DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
  - Install [Godot ‚â•4.2](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
  - Clone this repo
  - Generate a twitch token for your twitch account: <https://twitchtokengenerator.com/>. You only need the scopes "chat:read" and "chat:edit" for now. Copy the **access token** and set it:
    - `cd JumpRoyale`
    - `dotnet user-secrets set twitch_access_token <your access token>`
    - `dotnet user-secrets set twitch_channel_name <your channel name>`
  - Ensure that you have a `GODOT4` environment variable:
    - Windows: modify system properties to set the environment variable to something like `C:\myPath\Godot_vx.y.z-stable_mono_win64.exe`
    - macOS: modify your shell's start-up script to add: `export GODOT4="/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot"`
- Building:
  - Run `dotnet restore`
  - Open in Godot
  - Click "Build" in Godot itself
- Running:
  - Same as "building", but click "Run" in Godot
- Testing
  - The project was made in 3 days, which already felt like a breakneck pace. You think there were time for tests? üòì
